RULE_1_1_ERRO_TXT:
  - All global variables that are accessed from IRQ must be declared as volatile to ensure that the compailer will not optimize it out.
  - All global variables that are updated in IRQ or Callback should be volatile.

RULE_1_2_ERRO_TXT:
 - Local variables should not be declared as volatile to ensure that the compiler will optimize it out.
 - Local variables should NOT be volatile.

RULE_1_3_ERRO_TXT:
 - Global variables should generally be avoided, except when necessary or when dealing with IRQs.
 - Do not use global vars outside IRQ.

RULE_1_4_ERRO_TXT:
 - Global variables should generally be avoided / Avoid code in IRQ. This logic could be implemented in main function.
 - Avoid use of global variables.

RULE_3_1_ERRO_TXT:
 - ISR shall be fast as possible, forbidden use of delay functions inside hardware interruption.
 - Forbidden use of delay functions within IRQ.

RULE_3_2_ERRO_TXT:
 - ISR shall be fast as possible, forbidden OLED update inside hardware interruption.
 - Forbidden use of gfx_mono_... functions within IRQ.

RULE_3_3_ERRO_TXT:

RULE_4_3_ERRO_TXT:
 - On most of the times you should use vTaskDelays in freertos tasks
 - Use vTaskDelays instead of delay_

RULE_4_4_ERRO_TXT:
 - Do not use global vars with RTOS! You dont need them. Use queue or semaphore
 - Use queue or semaphore instead global var
